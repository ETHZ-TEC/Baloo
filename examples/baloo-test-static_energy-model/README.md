This project evaluate the benefits of having communication rounds (vs no rounds), in a static framework (like TTW). The goal is to experimentally validate the latency and energy models for a Glossy-based NET layer protocol.

<!-- Written with the DPP-cc430 in mind, but should also work on for the sky mote (the timing or some operations might be different though). -->
